                        <p>Hello! My name is Andrianasy, and I’m a student at BYU-Idaho, currently studying web development. I’m passionate about creating dynamic, user-friendly websites and enhancing user experiences through thoughtful design and functionality. I am currently honing my skills in web design and development through the WDD 131 course and am excited to dive deeper into the fundamentals of dynamic web development.

                            Originally from Madagascar, I enjoy exploring the beautiful landscapes of my homeland, and I draw inspiration from my travels and cultural experiences. Beyond web development, I have a keen interest in other areas of technology, such as cybersecurity. I spend my free time reading about the latest tech trends, experimenting with different programming languages, and taking part in online coding challenges.
                            
                            I believe in continuous learning and always strive to expand my knowledge. When I'm not coding, I enjoy walking in the nature, reading, and spending time with friends and family.

                        <h3>Madagascar</h3>
                        <p>Madagascar, the world’s fourth-largest island, is located off the southeastern coast of Africa, offering an incredibly diverse and unique landscape. With rainforests, deserts, and stunning beaches, the island is a paradise for nature lovers. What truly sets Madagascar apart is its extraordinary biodiversity—over 90% of its wildlife, including iconic species like lemurs, chameleons, and the fossa, is found nowhere else on Earth.

In addition to its unique flora and fauna, Madagascar is home to a rich cultural heritage, with vibrant traditions and history that reflect its diverse ethnic groups. The island is a haven for ecotourism, with travelers flocking to its national parks and reserves to explore the untouched beauty of the landscape and its endemic wildlife.</p>
